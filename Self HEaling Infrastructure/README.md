# SelfHealing Sentinel Automation

## Overview
SelfHealing Sentinel is an advanced automation system designed to monitor, detect, and automatically remediate infrastructure issues. This project implements a comprehensive self-healing infrastructure using modern DevOps tools and practices to ensure high availability and resilience of systems.

## Key Features

- **Automated Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of infrastructure components using Prometheus and custom exporters
- **Intelligent Detection**: Advanced anomaly detection using machine learning algorithms to identify potential issues before they cause failures
- **Automated Remediation**: Pre-configured remediation actions for common failure scenarios
- **Scalable Architecture**: Event-driven scaling with KEDA based on system load and health metrics
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Complete infrastructure defined and managed through code
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logging of all detection and remediation actions for audit and improvement

## Technology Stack

- **Kubernetes**: Container orchestration platform
- **KEDA**: Kubernetes-based Event Driven Autoscaling
- **Ansible**: Infrastructure automation
- **Prometheus**: Monitoring and alerting
- **Python**: Custom scripts for anomaly detection and remediation logic
- **Grafana**: Visualization and dashboards

## Architecture

The SelfHealing Sentinel follows a closed-loop automation architecture:

1. **Collection**: Metrics and logs are collected from all infrastructure components
2. **Analysis**: Data is analyzed using both rule-based and ML-based approaches
3. **Decision**: The system determines the appropriate remediation action
4. **Execution**: Automated remediation is performed through Ansible or Kubernetes API
5. **Verification**: The system verifies the success of the remediation action
6. **Learning**: The system learns from each incident to improve future detection and remediation
